      tagline: Create a pipeline to analyze logs across environments.
      detailed: |-
        Create a pipeline to analyze various data and logs of applications running across different environments like Google Cloud, other clouds and on-premises
        You can choose whether to deploy your solution through the console directly or download as Terraform on GitHub to deploy later.
      architecture:
      - A web server deployed on Cloud Run generates web access logs when a user visits a sample website deployed on it. The web access logs are automatically sent to Logging.
      - Logging then routes the logs to a designated table in BigQuery per sink configured.
      - Files that contain application logs can be uploaded into a bucket in Cloud Storage. (This solution deploys a text file that contains a sample web access log in JSON format.)
      - BigQuery Data Transfer Service then periodically loads the file to a designated table in BigQuery per transfer configured.
      - You can run queries against the logs in the table or use Data Studio to visualize the logs.
